# Graph Line

Uses [Cytoscape.js](https://js.cytoscape.org/) to create simple graphs.

**Usage**

1. Add a node by click anywhere on the page. You'll be prompted to add a label. 
2. Add edges by selecting a node (source) then select another (or same) node for the target.

## Development

You can open the `index.html` file in your web browser and it will work. Or you can use [reload](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reload) to run a local webserver and automatically refresh the page on changes. 

	npm install reload
	./node_modules/reload/bin/reload -b
